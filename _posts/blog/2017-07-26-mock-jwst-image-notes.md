## Information on the JWST mock images

*  The pixel scale is not provided by the input dither images.  The pixel scale can be determined from the oversampled PSF.  The oversampled PSFs have a pixel scale of 0.0039625".  The native pixel scale is then 0.0317" for the NIRCam images.

*  Need to determine a minimum pixel size for aperture photometry in unresolved sources.
