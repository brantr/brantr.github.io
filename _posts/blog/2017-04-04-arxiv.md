# ArXiv Notes for 04/04/2017

## Dust attenuation, bulge formation and inside-out cessation of star-formation in Star-Forming Main Sequence galaxies at $$ z \sim 2 $$.

By Sandro Tacchella, et al., [1704.00733](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00733)

2D dust attenuation maps at $$\sim$$ 1 kpc resolution for 10 $$z\sim2$$ galaxies. Dust
corrections to H$$\alpha$$ and UV allow for reliable SFR with radius, see bulge and
disk growing together. At high mass, sSFR profiles are suppressed by 10x in the center
relative to outskirts.

## Characterizing the transition from diffuse atomic to dense molecular clouds in the Magellanic clouds with [CII], [CI], and CO

By Jorge L. Pineda et al., [1704.00739](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00739)

Carbon line lines-of-sight to 54 objects in LMC and SMC. Most molecular gas in LMC and SMC is Co-dark H2 ($$\sim 80$$\%). Larger X_CO than MW.

## A Comparison of Maps and Power Spectra Determined from South Pole Telescope and Planck Data

By Z. Hou et al., [1704.00884](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00884)

Study of consistency of 150 Ghz SPT and 143 Ghz Planck. Look consistent!  Improved SPT calibration.


## The properties of the first galaxies in the BLUETIDES simulation

By Stephen Wilkins et al., [1704.00954](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00954)

First galaxies in BLUETIDES. Matches UV luminosity functions, rapidly increasing SFRs. Dust
leads to steepening of UV LF. Accretion on SMBH is about 10\% of UV luminosity.
