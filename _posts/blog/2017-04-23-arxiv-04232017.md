# ArXiv Notes for 04/23/2017


## The KMOS Deep Survey (KDS) I: dynamical measurements of typical star-forming galaxies at $$z \simeq 3.5 $$

By O.J. Turner et al., [1704.06263](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06263)

Kmos spectroscopy of 77 $$z\sim 3.5$$ galaxies. Only 34\% are rotation dominated. Rotation
dominated systems are on the local circular velocity -- stellar mass relation.

## Galaxy Zoo: The interplay of quenching mechanisms in the group environment

By R.J. Smethurst et al., [1704.06269](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06269)

Galex + Galaxy Zoo 2.  Quenching not correlated with relative velocity, but group potential.

## Machine Learning Based Real Bogus System for HSC-SSP Moving Object Detecting Pipeline

By Hsing-Wen Ling et al., [1704.06413](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06413)

Identify possible object false identification through machine learning.

## Cloud structure of three Galactic infrared dark star-forming regions from combining ground and space based bolometric observations

By Yuxin Lin et al., [1704.06448](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06448)

Dust temperature and column density maps of IRDC, evolutionary stages.

## SILCC-Zoom: The dynamical and chemical evolution of molecular clouds

By D. Seifreid et al., [1704.06487](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06487)

AMR simulations of molecular cloud properties and CO-H2 conversion.


## GOLDRUSH. II. Clustering of Galaxies at $$z\sim 4âˆ’6$$ Revealed with the Half-Million Dropouts Over the 100 deg$$^2$$ Area Corresponding to 1 Gpc$$^3$$

By Yuichi Harikane et al., [1704.06535](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06535)

Clustering and stellar-mass-halo-mass ratio -- which declines by factor of 4 from 7 to 4 at 1e11 Msun.

## TRUST I: A 3D externally illuminated slab benchmark for dust radiative transfer

By Karl Gordon et al., [1704.06584](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06584)

Illuminated slab benchmark for RT modeling.
