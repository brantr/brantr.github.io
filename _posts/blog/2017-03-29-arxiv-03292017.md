# ArXiv Notes for 03/29/2017

## On the effective turbulence driving mode of molecular clouds formed in disc galaxies

By Keitaro Jin, et al., [1703.09709](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09709)

Measured the $$ b = \sigma_\rho / \mathcal{M} $$ parameter
for molecular clouds in disk simulations.  The parameter has
a lower limit of $$ b>0.2 $$, and shows a broad distribution
between compressive and solenoidal. The $$ b $$ value increases with resolution.

## Fast and scalable Gaussian process modeling with applications to astronomical time series

By Daniel Foreman-Mackey et al., [1703.09710](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09710)

Applications of Gaussian process modeling to transits,
oscillations, etc.

## The VLA-COSMOS 3 GHz Large Project: Continuum data and source catalog release

By Vernesa Smolcic, et al., [1703.09713](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09713)

VLA observations at 3GHz in COSMOS, reaching 2.3 $$ \mu $$Jy/beam, with >10000 radio sources.

Lots of VLA-COSMOS papers.

## Interpreting the Star Formation Efficiency of Molecular Clouds with Ionising Feedback

By Sam Geen, et al., [1703.10071](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10071)

Star formation simulations including ionizing feedback. The
time-dependent star formation efficiency in clouds can be
considerably larger than $$ \sim 0.01 $$ once ionization is
accounted for.
