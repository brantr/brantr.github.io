# ArXiv Notes for 04/20/2017


## A small-scale dynamo in feedback-dominated galaxies - II. The saturation phase and the final magnetic configuration

By Michael Reider and Romain Teyssier, [1704.05845](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05845)

Small scale dynamo with galaxies where substantial feedback processes are important. Saturation occurs when turbulent pressure is a few percent of the ISM pressure. Full equipartion occurs at late times with smooth disks.



## Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs). II. Discovery of 32 Quasars and Luminous Galaxies at 5.7 < z < 6.8

By Yoshiki Matsuoka et al., [1704.05854](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05854)

32 quasars at $$ 5.7 < z < 6.8 $$. Low luminosity.

## The Lyman Continuum Escape and ISM properties in Tololo 1247-232 - New Insights from HST and VLA

By Johannes Puschnig et al., [1704.05943](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05943)

Tololo 1247-232 has a 1.5% escape fraction.  Lya escape is 8%.


## Searches for New Milky Way Satellites from the First Two Years of Data of the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey: Discovery of Cetus III

By Daisuke Homma et al., [1704.05977](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05977)

New satellite at 250 kpc, Mv = -2.4.


## Great Optically Luminous Dropout Research Using Subaru HSC (GOLDRUSH). I. UV Luminosity Functions at z∼4−7 Derived with the Half-Million Dropouts on the 100 deg^2 Sky

By Yoshiaki Ono et al., [1704.06004](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06004)

Half a million galaxies at $$ 4 < z < 7$$.  Bright end of LF is not Schechter.
