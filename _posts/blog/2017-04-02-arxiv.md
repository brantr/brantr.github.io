# ArXiv Notes for 04/02/2017

## The Hydrangea simulations: galaxy formation in and around massive clusters

By Yannick Bahe, et al., [1703.10610](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10610)

24 cosmological zoom simulations of galaxies near clusters
with baryon particle mass of 1e6 Msun. Reproduces
cluster stellar mass functions.

## Dynamical cooling of galactic disks by molecular cloud collisions -- Origin of giant clumps in gas-rich galaxy disks

By Guang-Xing Li, [1703.10613](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10613)

Cloud-cloud collision model for cooling in galaxy disks, depends on ratio
of free fall time to cloud cooling timescale.

## The Cluster-EAGLE project: global properties of simulated clusters with resolved galaxies


By David Barnes, et al., [1703.10907](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10907)

Zoom simulations of 30 clusters with EAGLE model. Reproduce stellar mass
and black hole mass content of clusters.
