title: Restarting the research blog.

I've decided to (re)start the research blog to keep a better
record of everything I've been up to. Most of these entries
will be in bulleted form for convenience.

* JWST NIRCam/NIRSpec GTO proposal

The JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec GTO teams are submitting a 
joint proposal to execute a ~800h program in the 
CANDELS regions of GOODS-N and GOODS-S. The team met at
8AM Pacific in their regular telecon to discuss the
last few components to the proposal, including the
justification of parallel NIRCam/NIRSpec observations.

* JEWELS HST Proposal (PI Capak)

I agreed to help with Peter Capak's HST proposal for
WFC3 imaging in the COSMOS field. I offered to create a
figure comparing the sizes of the HUDF, CANDELS, and the
proposed HST-JEWELS fields.
