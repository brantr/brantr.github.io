# ArXiv Notes for 03/30/2017

## Near-Infrared MOSFIRE Spectra of Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies at $$ 0.2<z<4 $$

By Caitlin Casey, et al., [1703.10168](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10168)

450$$ \mu m $$ and 850$$ \mu m$ selected objects with
optical and near-IR spectra in COSMOS. Only 31/102 detected.
Evidence for $$ \sim 200 $$km/s outflows, and nebular emission lines.

## The first interferometric detections of Fast Radio Bursts

By M. Caleb et al., [1703.10173](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10173)

3 FRBs discovered with the UTMOST commissioning data. Must be at $$ >10^4 $$km.

## A New Method to Measure the Post-Reionization Ionizing Background from the Joint Distribution of Lyman-$$ \alpha $$ and Lyman-$$ \beta $$ Forest Transmission

By Frederick Davies, et al., [1703.10174](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10174)

Statistical analysis of $$ \alpha $$ and $$ \beta $$ forests
at $$ z\sim 6 $$. 0.2 dex uncertainty.

## Dynamical timescale of precollapse evolution inferred from chemical distribution in the Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1) filament

By Yunhee Choi, et al., [1703.10260](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10260)

CS and C17O observations of TMC-1, can model using chemistry
to determine the collapse time in different peaks.

## Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury XVIII. The High-mass Truncation of the Star Cluster Mass Function

By L. Clifton Johnson, et al., [1703.10312](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10312)

840 clusters with ages < 300 Myr in Andromeda. The canonical
cluster mass function would give $$ M^{-2} $$ above $$ 10^4 M_\odot $$, but only 15 are found. Cut-off mass correlates
with star formation rate surface density.

## Structure distribution and turbulence in self-consistently supernova-driven ISM of multiphase magnetized galactic discs

By Olivier Iffrig & Patrick Hennebelle, [1703.10421](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10421)

Measure the structure function in turbulence in a simulated
stratified box.
