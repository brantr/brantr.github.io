## Telecon

Evan and I discussed how to make progress on the initial
conditions. The current issue is that the gas circular
velocity does not account for the pressure gradient radially,
and, additionally, there is an issue with the calculation of
the radial gradient. I said I'd try my own implementation in 
the evening.

We then discussed the quarterly report. We have to submit
our first quarterly report on April 1. Evan offered to help
with content for the report as needed.

Evan is almost ready to distribute her thesis to the committee. She will do a final read through and then send it
out, hopefully later today.
