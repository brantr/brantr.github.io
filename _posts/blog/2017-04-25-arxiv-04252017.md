# ArXiv Notes for 04/25/2017


## Characterizing Dust Attenuation in Local Star-Forming Galaxies: Near-Infrared Reddening and Normalization

By A.J. Battisti et al., [1704.07426](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07426)

Near IR dust attenuation curve for 5500 star forming galaxies.


## Systematic Identification of LAEs for Visible Exploration and Reionization Research Using Subaru HSC (SILVERRUSH). I. Program Strategy and Clustering Properties of $$\sim$$2,000 Lya Emitters at z=6-7 over the 0.3-0.5 Gpc$$^2$$ Survey Area


By Masami Ouchi et al., [1704.07455](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07455)

About 2K Lya emitters at 5.7 and 6.6.  Bias of about 4.1 at $$z=6.6$$.  $$L_\star$$ LAEs
in $$10^{11} M_{\odot}$$ halos.

## An Estimation of the Star Formation Rate in the Perseus Complex

By Seyma Marcimek et al., [1704.07596](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07596)

Star formation efficiency in Perseus. SFR between YSO and Class 0 stages are roughly constant.

## JANUS: A bit-wise reversible integrator for N-body dynamics

By Hanno Rein and Daniel Tamayo, [1704.07715](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07715)

Bit-wise reversable integrator.  Figure 1 is appreciated.


## No evidence for a significant AGN contribution to cosmic hydrogen reionization

By S. Parsa et al., [1704.07750](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07750)

Revisit 22 xray sources in CANDELS.  Only 15 have robust xray, and only 12 are at z>4. Only one at z>5.
