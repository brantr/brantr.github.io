## Recovering the properties of high redshift galaxies with different JWST broad-band filters

By L. Bisgello et al., [1706.05063](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05063)

Tests of recovering the properties of high-redshift galaxies from simulated photometry at
redshifts $$ z \approx 7-10 $$.. Find
that stellar mass if over estimated if emission lines are included.
