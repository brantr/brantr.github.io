## Formation of Wide Binaries by Turbulent Fragmentation

By Jeong-Eun Lee et al. [1707.00223](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00223)

Wide low-mass binaries are hard to form, likely through turbulent fragmentation. ALMA observations of a known wide-separation protostellar binary, each with a circumstellar disk -- too young to have formed through binary evolution.

## Problems with KiDS

By George Efstathiou and Pablo Lemos [1707.00483](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00483)

Discrepancies between Planck and KiDS arise from internal data issues with KiDS.
