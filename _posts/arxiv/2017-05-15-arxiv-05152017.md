No preferential spatial distribution for massive stars expected from their formation

By Richard Parker & James Dale, [1705.04686](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04686)

Competitive accretion suggestions massive stars live in deeper potential wells.
Photoionization and stellar winds can prevent this.

## SKIRT: hybrid parallelization of radiative transfer simulations

By Sam Verstocken et al., [1705.04702](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04702)

Monte Carlo radiative transfer.  Distributed memory parallelization and shared
memory parallelization.
