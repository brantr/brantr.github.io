# ArXiv Notes for 05/24/2017

## Rapidly star-forming galaxies adjacent to quasars at redshifts exceeding 6


By R. Decarli et al., [1705.08662](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08662)

CII in galaxies at $$z>6$$ that are companions of
quasars. If CII is driven by SFR, they can correspond
to massive ellipticals at $$z\sim4$$.

## Extensive Globular Cluster Systems Associated with Ultra Diffuse Galaxies in the Coma Cluster

By P. van Dokkum et al., [1705.08513](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08513)

UDGs have large numbers of globulars given their 
luminosities, but not their dynamical mass.
