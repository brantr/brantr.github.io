# ArXiv Notes for 04/09/2017


## A comparison of the most massive quiescent galaxies from $$z\sim 3$$ to the present: slow evolution in size, and spheroid-dominated

By Shannon Patel et al., [1704.01969](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01969)

HSt observations of ten massive galaxies near
redshift 3. Median size evolves as 1/(1+z). Sersic works out to several Re.

## The impact of numerical oversteepening on the fragmentation boundary in self-gravitating disks

By Jannes Klee et al., [1704.02193](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02193)

2D shearing sheet simulations with self-gravity.  Different numerical limiters change fragmentation.
