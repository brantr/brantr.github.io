# ArXiv Notes for 05/07/2017


## CANDELS Sheds Light on the Environmental Quenching of Low-mass Galaxies

By Yicheng Guo et al., [1705.01946](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01946)

Quenched galaxies are closer to neighbors than SFR galaxies out to $$z\sim 1$$.

## Optical colours and spectral indices of $$z \sim 0.1$$ EAGLE galaxies with 3D dust radiative transfer code SKIRT

By James Trayford et al., [1705.02331](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02331)

EAGLE post processed with radiative transfer, including subgrid obscuration. Spectra
are publicly available.
