# ArXiv Notes for 07/23/2017

## Dark Matter Annihilation Feedback in cosmological simulations I: Code convergence and idealised halos

By Nikolas Iwanus et al. [1707.06770](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06770)

Implementation of dark matter annihilation in Gadget-2.

## Probing the Outflowing Multiphase Gas $$ \sim 1 $$ kpc Below the Galactic Center

By Blair D. Savage et al. [1707.06942](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06942)

STIS observations of outflows from the galactic center.

## Self-shielding of hydrogen in the IGM during the epoch of reionization

By Jonathan Chardin et al. [1707.06993](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06993)

Self-shielding becomes important above about $$ n_H \sim 3\times10^{-3}~\mathrm{cm}^{-3} $$.  Compute the photoionization rate vs. density in self-shielded regions.
