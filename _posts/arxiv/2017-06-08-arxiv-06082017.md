# ArXiv Notes for 06/08/2017
## The intrinsic characteristics of galaxies on the SFR-stellar mass plane at $$ 1.2<z<4 $$: I. the correlation between stellar age, central density and position relative to the main sequence

By Bomee Lee et al., [1706.02311](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02311)

Star formation rate, stellar mass, and morphology with mass-weighted stellar age. Find bend in SFR-mstar relation at high mass.

## Photometric redshift estimation via deep learning

By Antonio D'Isanto and Kai Lars Polsterer, [1706.02467](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02467)

Phot-z estimation via ccn directoy on images. Allows probabilistic regression for
image properties.
