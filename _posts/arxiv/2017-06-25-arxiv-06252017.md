# ArXiv Notes for 06/25/2017

## Galaxy Interactions Trigger Rapid Black Hole Growth: an unprecedented view from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey

By Andy D. Goulding et al., [1706.07436](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07436)

HSC survey constraining galaxy-galaxy major mergers in growing BHs.  About 140,000 spectroscopically confirmed objects.  Interacting galaxies are
much more likely to have obscured AGN than non-interacting objects.  

## Three-dimensional mapping of the local interstellar medium with composite data

By Letizia Capitanio et al., [1706.07711](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07711)

3D maps based on inversion of color excess data using Gaia DR1, APOGEE, and Pan-STARRS.
