# ArXiv Notes for 07/24/2017

## Witnessing galaxy assembly in an extended $$z \sim 3 $$ structure

By Michele Fumagalli et al. [1707.07003](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07003)

MUSE observations of an extended structure at redshift 3.

## Gas Content and Kinematics in Clumpy, Turbulent Star-forming Disks


By Heidi A. White et al. [1707.07005](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07005)

PdBI observations with Herschel of low-z galaxies with kinetic properties comparable to those on the $$ z\sim1.5 $$ star-forming main sequence.  Similar to high-z disks in v/sigma.
