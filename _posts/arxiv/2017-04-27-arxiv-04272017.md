# ArXiv Notes for 04/27/2017


## A Massive Prestellar Clump Hosting no High-Mass Cores


By Patricio Sanhueza et al., [1704.08264](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08264)

IRDC G28.24-00.19 with no high mass cores. Low virial parameters.

## No evidence for feedback: Unexceptional Low-ionization winds in Host galaxies of Low Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei at Redshift $$z\sim1$$

By Hassen Yusef et al., [1704.08348](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08348)

Winds in x-ray host galaxies. Winds in AGN similar to winds in star
forming galaxies.

## Measurement of the small-scale structure of the intergalactic medium using close quasar pairs


By Alberto Rorai et al., [1704.08366](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08366)

Pressure smoothing of the Lya on small scales, consistent with what is
needed for reionization.

## Fates of the dense cores formed by fragmentation of filaments: do they fragment again or not?

By Kazuyuki Sugimura et al., [1704.08441](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08441)

3D self-gravitating hydro simulations, looking at fragmentation of
fragments during collapse.
