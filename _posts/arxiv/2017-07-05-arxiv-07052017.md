## Using Artificial Neural Networks to Constrain the Halo Baryon Fraction during Reionization



By David Sullivan et al. [1707.01427](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01427)

Simulations of feedback during reionization. alo mass with half the cosmic mean baryon fraction has little variation as a function of ionization fraction.  Metal cooling and resolution drops the characteristic halo mass with half the mean baryon fraction. Use an NN that predicts baryon fraction based on halo properties.
