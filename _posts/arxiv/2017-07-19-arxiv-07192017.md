# ArXiv Notes for 07/19/2017

## Andromeda's Parachute: A Bright Quadruply Lensed Quasar at $$ z=2.377 $$

By Kate Rubin et al. [1707.05873](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05873)

KCWI spectroscopy of a quadruple quasar lens.

## COS-Burst: Observations of the Impact of Starburst-Driven Winds on the Properties of the Circum-Galactic Medium

By Timothy Heckman et al. [1707.05933](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05933)

Observations of quasars around 17 low-redshift galaxies with star bursts.  The CGM around
starburst galaxies has strong Lya, Si III, C IV, and perhaps O VI.  And C IV/Lya and
Si III/Lya are larger.  The Lya absorption widths are larger.
