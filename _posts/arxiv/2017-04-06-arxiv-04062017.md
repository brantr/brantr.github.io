## How Supernovae Launch Galactic Winds

By Drummond Fielding et al., [1704.01579](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01579)

Winds from global disks.  Wind energy loading is well-converged, but mass loading decreases with
resolution. SNR with cooling radii greater than
the disk scale height drive wind. Athena simulations. Logarithmic grids with 256^3. Box
length is 40 R_d, or about 12 kpc.
