# ArXiv Notes for 06/13/2017

## Effect of local environment and stellar mass on galaxy quenching and morphology at $$ 0.5 < z < 2.0 $$

By Lalitwadee Kawinwanichakij et al., [1706.03780](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03780)

Zfourge survey correlating environment and stellar mass with quenching. Environmental quenching is inefficient for low mass galaxies at high redshift. Environmental processes must change morphology on a timescale comparable to quenching.

## Stacking the Cosmic Web in Fluorescent Lyman alpha Emission with MUSE


By Sofia Gallego et al., [1706.03785](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03785)

Stacking of MUSE data. No Lya emission on intergalactic scales. Emission is detected in the CGM in the direction of neighboring galaxies.
