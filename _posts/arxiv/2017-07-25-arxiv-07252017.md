## Alignment Between Protostellar Outflows and Filamentary Structure

By Ian W. Stephens et al. [1707.08122](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08122)

Orientation of outflows in Perseus, check against Herschel filaments. Consistent with random alignments.  Angular momentum of protostars may be independent of filamentary structures.
