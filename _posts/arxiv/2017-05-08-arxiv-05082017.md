## On the connection between turbulent motions and particle acceleration in galaxy clusters

By D. Eckert et al., [1705.02341](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02341)

"Our results indicate a segregation in the turbulent velocity of radio halo and radio quiet clusters, with the turbulent velocity of the former being on average higher by about a factor of two."

By Erika Zetterlund et al., [1705.02388](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02388)

Molecular clouds in the Hi-Gal survey.
