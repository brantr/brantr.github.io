## A first constraint on the average mass of ultra diffuse galaxies from weak gravitational lensing

By Cristobal Sifon et al., [1704.07847](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07847)

Weak lensing from 784 UDGs in 18 clusters. Mass is less than $$10^{11} M_{\odot}$$.

By Takatoshi Shibuya et al., [1704.08140](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08140)

Catalog of about 2K Lya emitters at 5.7 and 6.6. 

## Numerical studies on the link between radioisotopic signatures on Earth and the formation of the Local Bubble. I. 60Fe transport to the solar system by turbulent mixing of ejecta from nearby supernovae into a locally homogeneous ISM

By Michael Matias Schulreich et al., [1704.08221](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08221)
