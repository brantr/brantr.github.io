# ArXiv Notes for 05/02/2017


## Supernova Simulations from a 3D Progenitor Model -- Impact of Perturbations and Evolution of Explosion Properties


By B. Muller et al., [1705.00620](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00620)

Affects of perturbations from convective shell burning on core collapse SN. Spherically 
symmetrical models revive their explosion later.

## Molecular Gas during the Post-Starburst Phase: Low Gas Fractions in Green Valley Seyfert Post-Starburst Galaxies

By Hassen Yusef et al., [1705.00668](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00668)

Post starburst galaxies in the green valley have reduced gas fractions.

## SILVERRUSH. III. Deep Optical and Near-Infrared Spectroscopy for Lya and UV-Nebular Lines of Bright Lya Emitters at z=6-7

By Takatoshi Shibuya et al., [1705.00733](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00733)

High-z LAEs do not have strong UV metal lines. LAEs differ in spectral properties
from faint LBGs.  Do not confirm HeII lines.

## Fluctuating feedback-regulated escape fraction of ionizing radiation in low-mass, high-redshift galaxies

By Maxime Trebitsch et al., [1705.00941](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00941)

Supernovae explosions regulate escape fraction.
