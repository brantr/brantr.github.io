# ArXiv Notes for 04/05/2017


## MUFASA: The assembly of the red sequence

By Romeel Dave et al., [1704.01135](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01135)

Quenching in Mufasa. The red sequence slope is driven by the steep
stellar mass function. Dry merging doesn't increase mass substantially
in the most massive galaxies. Strongly over-quenches satellites.

## The SAMI Galaxy Survey: mass as the driver of the kinematic morphology - density relation in clusters

By Sarah Brough et al., [1704.01169](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01169)

Kinematic morphology of early-type galaxies in 8 galaxy clusters.
Fraction of slow rotators increases with local environmental overdensity.
Dynamical friction causes slow rotators in galaxy groups to fall toward the center.

## A Halo Substructure in Gaia Data Release 1

By G. C. Myeong et al., [1704.01363](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01363)

Halo substructure identified in Gaia.  14 stars selected, 8 with spectrophotmetric distances.

## Thermal Feedback in the high-mass star and cluster forming region W51

By Adam Ginsburg et al., [1704.01434](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01434)

Alma observations around the W51 high-mass star forming complex.Extended
hot gas show that high-mass stars head a large volume and prevent it
from fragmenting.
