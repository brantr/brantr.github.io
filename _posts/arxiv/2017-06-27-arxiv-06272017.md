## Cloud Scale ISM Structure and Star Formation in M51

By Adam K. Leroy et al., [1706.08540](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08540)

PAWS survey of M51. ``We show that the cloud-scale surface density appears to be a reasonable proxy for mean volume density.'' ``The sense of the correlation is that gas with stronger self-gravity (higher b) forms stars at a higher rate (low tau_mol_dep). The different regions of the galaxy mostly overlap in tau_mol_dep as a function of b, so that low b explains the surprisingly high Ï„molDep found towards the inner spiral arms found by by Meidt et al. (2013).''

## Formation of Massive, Dense Cores by Cloud-Cloud Collisions


By Ken Takahira et al., [1706.08656](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08656)

Collision of clouds, relative velocity suppresses some dense cloud formation.
