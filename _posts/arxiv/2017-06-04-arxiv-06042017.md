# ArXiv Notes for 06/04/2017

## The evolving far-IR galaxy luminosity function and dust-obscured star-formation rate density out to $$z\sim 5$$


By M.P. Koprowski et al., [1706.00426](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00426)

Contribution of IR objects to SFR density at high redshift has been overestimated
by Herschel. UV galaxies dominate SFR density at redshifts $$z>4$$.

## Simulating radiative feedback and star cluster formation in GMCs: II. Mass dependence of cloud destruction and cluster properties

By Corey Howard et al., [1706.00477](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00477)

Stellar feedback reduces cluster formation efficiency by a factor of 2.  Power
law relationship between cluster mass and GMC mass.

## Deep Optical Imaging of the COSMOS Field with Hyper Suprime-Cam Using Data from the Subaru Strategic Program and the University of Hawaii

By Masayuki Tanaka et al., [1706.00566](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00566)

Deep imaging to $$m\sim 26-28$$ in COSMOS with HSC.  Data available at [https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/doc/](https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/doc/).
