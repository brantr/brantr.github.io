# ArXiv Notes for 06/11/2017

## The abundance of ultra-diffuse galaxies from groups to clusters: UDGs are relatively more common in more massive haloes

By Remco van der Burg et al., [1706.02704](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02704)

UDGs in galaxy groups in GAMA have significant overdensities in 
halos MW-sized and larger.  Abundance is almost linear in halo mass,
and are more abundant relative to satellites in groups.

## Cosmology at at Crossroads: Tension with the Hubble Constant


By Wendy Freedman, [1706.02739](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02739)

Tension in the Hubble constant.
