## An amplified dusty star-forming galaxy at z=6: unveiling an elusive population of galaxies

By Jorge A. Zavala et al. [1707.09022](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09022)

Spec redhift dusty galaxy at z = 6, 380 msun/yr.  Gas and dust properties similar to
local ULIRGs.

## Evolution of Galaxy Luminosity and Stellar-Mass Functions since z=1 with the Dark Energy Survey Science Verification Data

By D. Capozzi et al. [1707.09066](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09066)

Redshift evolution of luminosity and stellar-mass functions from DES commissioning data.

## Towards time symmetric N-body integration


By Walter Dehnen [1707.09069](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09069)

Claim is exact time reversiblility is elusive to discretized time steps.
