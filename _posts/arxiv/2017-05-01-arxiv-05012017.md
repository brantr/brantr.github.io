# ArXiv Notes for 05/01/2017


## Galaxy Zoo: Finding offset discs and bars in SDSS galaxies


By Sandor Kruk et al., [1705.00007](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00007)

``We find that the majority of galaxies with off-centre bars are of Magellanic type...'

## Fully Coupled Simulation of Cosmic Reionization. III. Stochastic Early Reionization by the Smallest Galaxies

By Pengfei Chen et al., [1705.00026](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00026)

Use PDFs from Renaissance simulations to compute ionized fractions and reionization history.

## Testing the universality of the star formation efficiency in dense molecular gas

By Y. Shimariji et al., [1705.00213](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00213)

Observations of multiple molecular clouds in multiple tracers.  Find star formation efficiency in dense clouds is constant over 8 orders of magnitude.

## What are we learning from the relative orientation between density structures and the magnetic field in molecular clouds?

By Juan Soler and Patrick Hennebelle [1705.00477](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00477)

Density gradients and magnetic fields are mostly parallel, but break in convergent flows.
