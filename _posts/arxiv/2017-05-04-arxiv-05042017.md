# ArXiv Notes for 05/04/2017


## The Globular Cluster -- Dark Matter Halo Connection

By Mike Boylan-Kolchin, [1705.01548](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01548)

Early globular cluster formation. Possible that high-z galaxies are mostly GCs.

## Stellar streams as gravitational experiments I. The case of Sagittarius

By Guillame Thomas et al., [1705.01552](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01552)

MOND can reproduce the Sag stream.


## Feeding vs. Falling: The growth and collapse of molecular clouds in a turbulent interstellar medium

By Juan Ibanez-Mejia et al., [1705.01779](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01779)

Suggest molecular clouds are always contracting. Conversion of grav PE to kinetic energy
during contraction is what drives turbulence.

## Probing dark matter with star clusters: a dark matter core in the ultra-faint dwarf Eridanus II

By Filippo Contenta et al., [1705.01820](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01820)

Eridanus II may have a dark matter core.


## The structure and statistics of interstellar turbulence

By Alexei Kritsuk et al., [1705.01912](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01912)

Properties of MHD turbulence. Reproduces lots of properties of molecular clouds. Suggest
efficiency per free fall time is a consequence of thermodynamcis in molecular clouds.
