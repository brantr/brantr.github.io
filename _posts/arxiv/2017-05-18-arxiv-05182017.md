# ArXiv Notes for 05/18/2017


## Hierarchical Star Formation in Turbulent Media: Evidence from Young Star Clusters

By K. Grasha et al., [1705.06281](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06281)

Cluster age difference increases with separation. Galactic environment affects maximum cluster size.

## The Galaxy Clustering Crisis in Abundance Matching

By Duncan Campbell et al., [1705.06347](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06347)

Galaxy clustering on small scales is under-predicted by abundance matching based on
peak halo mass, but peak vmax is better.  But fixes require orphan galaxies, 
satellite growth after accretion, or stellar mass depends on halo assembly.

## The Lyman Continuum escape fraction of emission line-selected $$ z\sim 2.5$$ galaxies is less than 15%

By Michael Rutkowski et al., [1705.06355](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06355)

No Lyman Continuum from SFGs selected on OII nebular emission.

## Deep Learning Classification in Asteroseismology


By Marc Hon et al., [1705.06405](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06405)

CNN of features of red giant power spectra.
