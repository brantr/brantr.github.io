## Compression of turbulent magnetized gas in Giant Molecular Clouds

By Yuval Birnboim et al., [1705.09657](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09657)

Adiabatic compression of a magnetized turbulent medium, following Robertson & Goldreich 2012.

## Rise of the Titans: A Dusty, Hyper-Luminous "870 micron Riser" Galaxy at z~6

By Dominik Reichers et al., [1705.09660](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09660)

Dusty major merger at $$z\sim 5.7$$ with ALMA. About 1e11 solar masses of gas and a star formation rate of 2400 solar masses per year.

## A population of faint low surface brightness galaxies in the Perseus cluster core

By Carolin Wittmann et al., [1705.09697](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09697)

Faint LSBs in Perseus, "ultra-diffuse" with half-light radii of 0.7-1.4 kpc. Some are associated with tidal streams.
