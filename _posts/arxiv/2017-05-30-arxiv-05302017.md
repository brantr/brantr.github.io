## Modelling ultraviolet-line diagnostics of stars, the ionized and the neutral interstellar medium in star-forming galaxies

By A. Vidal-Garcia et al., [1705.10320](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10320)

Combined stellar plus nebular emission model by Stephane's group. Neglectic stochastic sampling of the IMF biases stellar mass estimates (but not UV age or metallicity). Most UV indices are prone to contamination by ISM.  Some emission and absorption features are clean ISM phase tracers.
