## The Effect of Thermal Velocities on Structure Formation in N-body Simulations of Warm Dark Matter

By Matteo Leo et al., [1706.07837](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07837)

Including thermal velocities in WDM simulations leads to excess power affected by noise.  Increasing resolution shifts the deviations to smaller scales.
