## Hydrodynamic simulations of mechanical stellar feedback in a molecular cloud formed by thermal instability

By Christopher J. Wareing et al., [1706.01844](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01844)

Mechanical energy input from massive stars into 100pc scales. The most massive stars destroy the surrounding molecular gas.
