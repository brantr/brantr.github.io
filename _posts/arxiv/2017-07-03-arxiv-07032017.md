# ArXiv Notes for 07/03/2017

## On the evolution of the central density of quiescent galaxies

By Sandro Tacchella et al. [1707.00695](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00695)

Stellar central mass density from Zurich Environmental Study.  At fixed
stellar mass, old quescient galaxies have higher central densities than
young QGs. Galaxies on the stellar central density ridgeline at later 
times have lower densities -- "progenitor bias".

## The Morphological Transformation of Red Sequence Galaxies in Clusters since $$ z \sim 1 $$

By P. Cerulo et al. [1707.00751](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00751)

Galaxies classified by bulge-to-total light. S0s increase by 20% from $$ z\sim1.5$$ to $$ z \sim 0$$.
