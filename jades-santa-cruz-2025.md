## JADES Team Meeting Santa Cruz 2025

### Overview

Discoveries with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the revolutionary NASA/ESA/CSA observatory launched in December 2021, have challenged the scientific community to rethink our picture for how galaxies form and evolve at the earliest times in universal history. The international JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) has been at the forefront of these discoveries, providing the largest and most comprehensive view of the distant universe with Webb and shattering the record for the most distant known galaxy multiple times in a few short years. With the first completed set of our observations now in hand, the JADES collaboration will meet in Santa Cruz, CA in January 2025 to 1) set our scientific course for the next two years, 2) plan for the most vital future observations and theoretical efforts that both leverage existing JWST data and break new ground, and 3) empower our growing set of early career collaboration members to take scientific leadership roles in JADES and beyond. 


### Goals

Our goals for the meeting will focus on three priorities. With a firmer picture of the available JWST data, we can

* identify the collaboration scientific efforts over the next two years that will form the core activities of the team. Given the rapid change in our knowledge of the distant universe

* plan the new observations and theoretical efforts needed to understand how galaxies form at the earliest times. 

* provide a forum newly established early career and under-represented members of JADES to take scientific leadership roles by helming our active working groups.
